# civo\_snapshot

Provides a resource which can be used to create a snapshot from an existing Civo Instance.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "civo_snapshot" "myinstance-backup" {
    name = "myinstance-backup"
    instance_id = civo_instance.myinstance.id
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A name for the instance snapshot.
* `instance_id` - (Required) The ID of the Instance from which the snapshot will be taken.
* `safe` - (Optional) If `true` the instance will be shut down during the snapshot to ensure all files 
are in a consistent state (e.g. database tables aren't in the middle of being optimised 
and hence risking corruption). The default is `false` so you experience no interruption 
of service, but a small risk of corruption.
* `cron_timing` - (Optional) If a valid cron string is passed, the snapshot will be saved as an automated snapshot 
continuing to automatically update based on the schedule of the cron sequence provided 
The default is nil meaning the snapshot will be saved as a one-off snapshot.
